Connect4 Game with AI by Sam Saxon

In Connect4, players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tiles from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid.
The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column.
The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tiles.
The goal of this project was to create an AI that plays Connect4 (somewhat well) against the player.

Run the main method in the Game class to get started.
Click numbered buttons to make a move, RESET button to reset, or drop down boxes to change either difficulty or the game mode.

Notes:
Difficulty 1 is the easiest (default), difficulty 6 has a ~1-2 second delay. ONLY CLICK ONCE THEN WAIT.
Computer always plays as player 2 (Red)
Settings can be switched mid-game
When the computer plays, scores are displayed in the console. AI picks column with lowest score to place move in.
